<h1>Ascend Project in Unreal 5.0</h1>
Plan was to create a fast paced parkour game, where player using abilities would complete "quests" that would require him to, as fast as possible, reach another person in the city. Unfortunately beacuse of bunch of private reasons we couldn't finish the project and what we ended with is:

<h4>Player abilities</h4>Wall running, dashes, grapple, explosive mine which boosts the player
<h4>Block out of the city</h4>
<h4>Simple quest system</h4> compass to a destination, time tracing etc.
<h4>Playground level for abilities testing</h4>
<h4>Interactive enviroment parts</h4> Ladder, jump pad, etc.
<h4>Fantastic music</h4>

Project is done with blueprints and C++.

Most important classes are player character, abilities, ability manager.
